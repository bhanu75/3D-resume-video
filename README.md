At around 1:45 PM today (July 27, 2025), I began facing multiple issues while trying to record and share a video using Loom.

Initially, Loom became very slow — it took too much time to download and was unresponsive even after I had successfully signed in. To resolve this, I switched my browser from Chrome to Brave, which allowed me to access Loom and start the recording.

However, during the recording, another issue occurred: as soon as I switched tabs, my microphone stopped capturing audio. As a result, the audience couldn't hear my voice after that point. I verified this problem by reviewing the video and shared the link, confirming the issue with the date and time.

After two failed recording attempts on my desktop, I decided to use my phone. I recorded a simple 3-minute video using the default camera app. Due to limited storage space, I couldn’t record for longer.

Finally, I was able to upload the video successfully at 2:55 PM on July 27, 2025.
